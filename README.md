Introduction
---
This is a basic PHP-framework that I've started due to school purposes. When I started on my PBA in Web Development, my teacher didn’t fancy the idea of using a pre-existing framework because he felt  it was a bit like cheating. So… I created my own instead. This way I could still work with a MVC pattern.

_**Disclaimer:** this isn’t finished software. If you’re looking for a framework to use for commercial purposes, then I suggest you look at something like CodeIgniter, CakepPHP, Zend or Symfony instead._

Capabilities
---
_The framework is primarily made to get the advantages of a MVC structure and not as a tool for faster development within a MVC enviroment. Future plans will include more helpers and a library function._
* MVC structure.
* Choose between PDO or MySQLi connection.
* A basic router that can handle up to 5 arguments per route.
* A few URL helpers are already implemented.

Installation

Contributing

The project in itself have no real future plans nor will it be abandoned completely. I'm slowly adding to it and improving it over time when I need more for school purpose, since I will continue to use it for semester-exams projects.

With that said; if you have any improvements you feel like pushing, then I’ll be more than happy to accept them if they help in any way.
